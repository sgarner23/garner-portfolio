    "I'm a full stack web developer looking for a new role with an exciting company. I'm committed to developing applications with clean modular code and learning as much as I can. When building applications in JavaScript, I frequently use React and Node, and I can adapt to whatever tools are required. I'm based in SLC, Utah, but I'm happy working remotely or relocating for the right opportunity. I have a B.S. degree from Weber State University and Web Development training from DevMountain. When I'm not coding, you'll usually find me running around with my three year old daughter. I'd love for you to check out some of my work!",
